            weaknesses to any types. Start off by selecting your favorites, to
            see how they match up to the other types! If you want to remove any

              <Typography>
                The radar chart compares two Pokémon's stats! The max axes
                values are capped out at 160 by default, as this is a common
                value among famous legendary Pokémon (such as Mewtwo, with a
                Special Attack of 154, or Lugia, with a Special Defense of 154).
                But, if either Pokémon has a stat value of over 160, than the
                max value of all axes are dynamically recalculated to that new
                highest stat value! This is because some Pokémon have massive
                stat outliers; Blissey has an HP value of 255! Compare it to a
                strong Pokémon like Mewtwo to see this dynamic recalculation,
                preserving scale of differences.
